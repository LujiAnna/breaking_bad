Based on Figma mockup.

## Requirements
- The language buttons on top should update the copy. English should be in there, add at least one other language. We won't be evaluating the translation, of course
- The 2 buttons should redirect to, in order:
    1. https://lujianna.github.io/BreakingBadQuotes/
    2. https://lujianna.github.io/break_bad/
- The webpage should be made responsive. Seeing as the design is not complex, the mobile version can be a vertically stacked variant of the design
- Feel free to give your own twist to the page
    
## Testing
Language switching should be tested, anything else is optional. Quality over quantity!

## Evaluation
Double check:
- The visuals of your implementation and how it relates to the mockup
- The quality of your code. Think best practices, cleanliness, readability, ...
